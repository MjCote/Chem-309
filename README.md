### Summary of Key Quantum Ideas

The first "serious" task I'd like you take on with this web page is to
write up the key quantum ideas we've discussed so far, with an emphasis on
the transition from the function picture to the linear algebra picture. 

# What is a wavefunction?
A wavefunction provides the complete description of a quantum state. We will begin to use state vectors as the complete description of a quantum state in order to organize this information and manipulate it using linear algebra. In order to determine different qualities of a wavefunction, or state vector, an operation must be performed. Operating on wavefunction yields an observable, or a value specific to that quantum state. Different operators provide different information - there are operators for position, momentum, energy, etc.
