function plotPIB1D( n )
%remember, n refers to the number of eigenvectors generated
%here are my constants: 
%m is mass, L is length of box, barht height of barrier, w is the barrier
%width 

m = 1;
L = 5e-9;
hbarsq = ((6.626*10^-34)/pi)^2; 
barht = 1e6;
w=3; 
pts = 250;

%now account for the delta x and discritize the number of elements in the x vector 
%We say that there are some number of points within the x vector
x = linspace(0, L, pts);
dx = x(2)-x(1);

%x is a vector that goes from 0 to 5 separated by some amount, dictated by
%the number of points. Vvec is a vector with the dimension of pts entries
%with one column
%now we have some number, points of entries in the x vector
Vvec = zeros(pts, 1);
Vvec([1:w, end - (w-1):end]) = barht;
%We created a vector of zeros, but we just set the first three and the last
%three entries (because w=3) equal to some barht (large number, using 1e6)

%plot vvec to see w
% figure(1) 
% plot(x, Vvec)
%Now we Vvec on the diagonal of our potential matrix
V = diag(Vvec);

%making the second derivative matrix
D2 = -2*eye(n) + diag(ones(n-1,1), 1) + diag(ones(n-1,1),-1);
%now account for the delta x idea by subtracting the first element from the
%second element because they will be evenly spaced, and multiply the matrix
%by the constants 
T = 1/(dx^2)*(-hbarsq/(2*m))*D2;

%here's our Hamiltonian, which accounts for both the potential energy and
%kinetic energy
H= T + V;

%now we want to solve for the eigenvalues of the
